## Requirements

- Go v1.20 or higher
- MongoDB instance
- Git
- Node.js and npm (for initial project setup if converting from Node.js)

```

- `main.go`: Entry point of the application.
- `handlers/`: Contains handler functions for different API endpoints.
- `models/`: Defines the data models.
- `db/`: Manages database connections.
- `.env`: Environment variables file.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/golang-restful-api.git
   cd golang-restful-api
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Go installed and then install dependencies using:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:

   Start the server by running:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

5. **Test API Endpoints**:

   You can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints listed below.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint        | Description               |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| POST   | /users          | Create a new user         |
| GET    | /users          | Retrieve all users        |
| GET    | /users/{id}     | Retrieve a specific user  |
| DELETE | /users/{id}     | Delete a specific user    |
| PUT    | /users/{id}     | Update a specific user    |

## Environment Variables

Ensure you have the following variables set in your `.env` file:

- `MONGO_URI`: The connection string for your MongoDB instance.
- `PORT`: Port on which the server will run.

## Testing

*To be implemented:* Unit and integration tests using Go's testing package and a suitable testing framework.

## CI/CD Pipeline

*To be implemented:* A complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, including:

- Code linting and formatting checks.
- Unit and integration tests.
- Security scans.
- Automatic deployment to a staging environment.
- Notifications and monitoring setup.

## Future Work

- Add test cases for all handler functions.
- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Integrate with Docker for containerized deployment.
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline as outlined.
